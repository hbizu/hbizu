- 👋 Hi there, I’m @hbizu (Heloísa - 19F)
- 💻 I study computer engineering at IFMG. 
- 🌱 I live in Brazil, but I´m currently looking forward to having an international opportunity. 
- 💞️ I’m interested in biotechnology, computational biology, nanotechnology and astrophysics. I´m also obsessed with reading.
(but I can work with everything lol)
- 📝 Portuguese is my first language, but I also speak English fluently.
- 📫 You can reach me at heloisa.bizu.pereira@gmail.com 
- 🌼 And, to get to know me better, I strongly believe that
- "Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end"
- "Only you can decide what breaks you"
